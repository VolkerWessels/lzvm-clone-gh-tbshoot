# DO NOT ADD SUBNETS BEFORE YOU HAVE CREATED THE VNETS

# Example of how to add subnets to the VNETs
# if you do not define subnets, none will be created
# if you do not add a delegation, none will be created

# IMPORTANT: to provision subnets, you will need to run the lzvm on an already existing landingzone that has a vnet
# You will need to know the address space of the vnet to determine the address_prefix of the subnets, you need to manually calculate the address_prefix
# Here is a link to a subnet calculator: https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html
